## Usage

To use this application, you must first install Node.js and MongoDB. Then, install necessary dependencies with the following command:

```
npm i
```

Now you may start the application with the following command:

```
npm start
```

There is currently no front end for this application, so you must use Insomnia to execute all requests.
